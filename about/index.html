<p><img src="/assets/img/edward.png" class="mb-2" /></p>

<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio!</p>

<p>I’m Edward Nguyen, a product designer and researcher (generalist) with over seven years of professional design experience. I’ve spent years on smaller design teams or even as a team of one, driving impact and leading design while helping companies grow their revenue by millions annually. Because of my smaller team background, I have extensive design collaboration experience with other teams including Sales, Customer Support and Success, Marketing, Product, Engineering, and QA.</p>

<p>I previously designed at:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, working on key internal data applications used by Reddit sales and product teams to drive productivity gains.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.costco.com/" target="_blank">Costco</a>, where I led several key initiatives including their first ever prescription eyewear experience.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.skilljar.com/" target="_blank">Skilljar</a>, where I was the sole designer and led all major design and research projects while leveling up their UCD thinking.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.liquidplanner.com/" target="_blank">LiquidPlanner</a>, I led design for several key features and was ultimately promoted to a Sr. UX position.</li>
</ul>

<p>I studied UX design at the <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/msim" target="_blank">University of Washington Information School</a>. As a student I interned with teams at <a href="https://www.apptio.com/" target="_blank">Apptio</a> and <a href="https://www.vertafore.com/" target="_blank">Vertafore</a>.</p>

<h2>My design philosophy</h2>
<p>Throughout my design journey I’ve been exposed to all sorts of tactics and processes that are either utilized or not at all kinds of organizations. Agile UX, lean UX, user personas, JTBD (jobs-to-be-done), design sprints. These all have their place but my philosophy boils down to a few key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can’t build a sticky product without understanding what users are going through. So I spend considerable energy and time with users throughout my design process.</li>
  <li>I seek to align my cross-functional team and stakeholders with regular check-ins to both solicit feedback and ideas for my designs but also to ensure technical constraints are met and timelines are feasible.</li>
  <li>Shared empathy drives winning teams. I often share research findings with my project team to drive empathy for users and align the team on my recommendations. This makes explaining design rationale and strategy easier and gets even the most hesitant teammates to understand the value of design.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Currently</h2>
<p><strong>I’m currently exploring new product design opportunities at the mid or senior level</strong>! I especially feel I could be a great fit embedded in start-ups, smaller design teams or on internal tools that can utilize an experienced design generalist who operates efficiently with product, ENG and other XFN collaborators.</p>

<h2>Fun facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’m big on fast, interactive prototypes and user testing. Check out my <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/customer-success/liquidplanner" target="_blank">UXPin testimonial</a>.</li>
  <li>As a graduate student I designed a gaming application for Google Glass and was a top-12 finalist at the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2559206.2580933" target="_blank">CHI 2014 Student Design Competition</a>. It involved running from Zombies!</li>
  <li>During my tenure at Skilljar, they <a href="https://www.skilljar.com/blog/skilljar-awarded-inaugural-ux-design-of-the-year-at-the-2020-geekwire-awards/" target="_blank">won a Geekwire UX of the Year Award</a>, something I’m very proud of!</li>
  <li>I’m a boxing and MMA fan and watch it on weekends if I can.</li>
  <li>I’m a PC gamer!</li>
  <li>I run a cooking / recipe site featuring traditional Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine.</li>
</ul>
