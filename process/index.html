<h4>It starts with empathy</h4>

<p>When investigating potential improvements to a product or feature, my goal is to understand context of use. I look for:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The motivation or causality the user has for using the product or feature</li>
	<li>The desired outcome with using the product or feature</li>
	<li>The context around their lives that could yield critical design implications</li>
	<li>The product or feature's usability within a scenario</li>
</ol>

<p>Interviewing and spending time with users yields the most insights, as does observing their behavior and direct feedback. Internal stakeholder interviews are also helpful for signal and alignment.</p>

<h4>Define learnings and design implications</h4>

<p>A deep understanding of the user leads to new perspectives which, in turn, spawn novel solutions to their needs. After discovery and research activities, distilling learnings in the form of detailed user scenarios, along with the challenges, frustrations, needs, goals, and motiviations, are helpful for solutioning. Insights and "a-ha's" should be drawn, as well as guiding design principles or visions for the solution. I enjoy using storyboards to developed shared empathy into the scenario that we flesh out in interviews.</p>

<h4>Exploring solutions and prototyping</h4>

<p>I utilize divergent/convergent thinking for rapid ideation. Design workshops/jams are a helpful team exercise to generate many solutions rapidly. This is a time to focus the experience and iterate until a well thought-out solution can be prototyped and tested with users to determine utility and usability. Logging design assumptions is also critical for validation in user testing. I consider myself a power user with UXPin, a web-based prototyping tool. I've used it so much that I'm featured on their testimonials - <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/customer-success/liquidplanner" target="_blank" class="process-link">check it out here</a>.</p>

<h4>Iteration and hand off</h4>

<p>I generally conduct usability tests with five to eight participants, five minimum. Providing task-based scenarios is critical at this stage, as is validating design assumptions. They key is to observe the user try the design to achieve their desired outcomes or goals discovered in research. Does it provide the functionality or feature they need? How were the usability factors? These all yield learnings for design improvement.</p>
