        <h4>1. Understand the users</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/img/understand-users.png" /></p>

<p>Goal-based design is at the heart of how I operate. I adhere to Alan Cooper’s ‘goal-based design’, discovering and unearthing what and why users are using your product or service. Direct interviews and contextual inquiry are required to fully immerse ourselves in the user’s domain. Personas are a key design artifact to share empathy among stakeholders once we’ve learned about users, their goals, pains, needs, and tasks. I love utilizing scenarios (or storyboards) and journey maps where appropriate to fully communicate and understand a user’s interactions with the product.</p>

<p><i>In some cases, full-on research is not possible</i>, for any number of reasons. In these cases, I typically employ a lean UX methodology that includes catalogging what we know about the problem, and logging assumptions to be tested with users directly. Logging assumptions helps me validate the assumptions, problem, and solution with users.</p>

<h4>2. Ideate and refine</h4>

<p>With a strong understanding of the user, generating many ideas with a diverge - converge method is ideal. I like to work collaboratively across the organization to share design concepts with stakeholders or team members closely familiar with the design problem at hand. At this stage I like thinking about pros and cons of a particular design, and logging questions I might still have to ask users in user testing. In the past, I’ve developed prototypes using HTML/CSS, but also tools like UXPin or Invision to be used in usability testing with users. Assessing a design with users is a great way to determine if it solves their problem and provides value.</p>

<h4>3. Ship and monitor</h4>

<p>Once a design is refined, I typically red-line or create spec documents to hand off to the engineering teams. I enjoy working closely to make the design become a reality.</p>

<p>After shipping, close monitoring to examine usage, and follow-up interviews with users of the feature or product are key to determine if the approach is on-track.</p>
