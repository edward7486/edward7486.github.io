God forbid the kid also needs to buy a car coming out of school. Although the data in this study is important, the conclusion doesn't match up - one doesn't need 50K in debt to be underwater. One only needs to be coming from a lower middle class family with limited ability to continue to support young adults.",

The base year of 1992 is well after the 'trickle down' years started.  It would be good to see figures from before that time.I think the situation now would look far worse.",
