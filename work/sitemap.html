<p>At Apptio, I'm lucky to be constantly challenged by my work and my peers. I'm surrounded by talented individuals designing and building awesome products.</p>

<h4>Persona Research</h4>

<p>My first and ongoing project is on persona (actor) research. I'm regularly interview customer success and consulting teams (internal employees who work directly with Apptio customers and know their frustrations, goals, desires, and pain points best) to refine and update the actors as accurately as possible.</p>

<h4>Sitemap and Front-End Development</h4>

<p>My next project is also ongoing and involves building a detailed sitemap, and leading front-end redesign of an existing Apptio product. With the sitemap in its fourth and final revision state, I've since turned my attention to building the interactive prototype. I'm using HTML/CSS/JS (Bootstrap) and eventually will be integrating Java code into my prototype to generate the Java server pages.</p>
