<h4>Background Information</h4>
<p>Apptio builds products that focus on IT Cost Transparency, allowing executives and managers to make strategic and insightful decisions regarding their IT costs. Datalink is a product I worked on during my internship. It is a product focused on data ingestion, allowing users to sync various sources of their financial data directly into Apptio's products.</p>

<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>Datalink didn't have any documentation of their information architecture. This was needed as a majority of products at Apptio do have them and are readily accessible organization wide.</p>

<h4>Design and Iteration</h4>
<p>I focused on hierarchical structure and design of the sitemap. I went through four iterations, each time reviewed by the Director of Product Design here at Apptio. Most iterations focused on organizing content more structurally so the parent-child relationships were more apparent, and fixing small errors with content.</p>

<h4>Four Iterations.. Final</h4>
<p>My end goal was to give an understanding of the information architecture, site contents, and possibly the purpose of the product to anyone looking at the sitemap, no matter which department of the company they were in. The final result was used as official documentation at Apptio. <a href="/assets/img/work/sitemap/v1.4-Sitemap.pdf" target="_blank">View the pdf</a></p>
