<h4>The Problem / Focus</h4>
<p>Our team will be focusing on building a novel approach to integrating user comments directly into interactive data visualizations. This is not so much a problem as it is a concept that is worthwhile to explore, to see if user experience can be improved for the users of interactive visualizations. By bringing up comments directly into or adjacent to the visualization space, users can more easily view dialogues that pertain to points of interest, and discover stories and insights they might normally miss.</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>Weâ€™ll figure out how to seamlessly integrate comments so they do not interfere with the interactive visualizations themselves. Some guerilla research might be involved (asking users if they prefer the visualization as a distinct layer from the comments, which could be another layer). A storyboard will be made to test out concepts and ideas and get some feedback from users. Finally, an interactive prototype will be built using standard web technology like HTML/ CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js.</p>

<h4>Storyboard</h4>
<p>To get my initial concept across, I created a storyboard to detail the layout and basic interactions. My intention with this design is to keep the data visualization layer separate from the commenting layer - this is because interactive visualizations often already have hover effects (informational tooltips). Also, I felt that automatically showing comments might be unwanted - and naturally users should be able to explore a visualization and come to their own conclusions first before reading other users' opinions and thoughts. The comment section will start minimized and can be reopened and closed to activate the user comment layer. <i>Click image to open in new tab.</i></p>

<h4>User Feedback &amp; To Be Continued</h4>
<p>At this point in the project, I will be building a quick and adaptable prototype to test ideas and concepts, before committing too much time to developing a "final version". Check back soon!</p>
