<h4>A Learning Process</h4>
<p>I'm currently reading some books written by Edward Tufte, namely "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information" and "Envisioning Information". I've learned some key principles about design for data graphics. Below, you'll find two assignments I've completed for a graduate course I'm taking, Advanced Information Visualization. Click the pictures to view the full .pdf reports, which I put a ton of effort and work into!</p>

<h4>World Disasters</h4>
<p>I visualized an interesting story from a dataset about natural disasters in the world, in .csv format. Document opens in a new tab.</p>

<h4>National Education Survey of 1988</h4>
<p>For this data visualization, I used Tableau to explore and answer a question I had about this dataset. Report opens in a new tab.</p>
