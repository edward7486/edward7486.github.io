<!-- Overview !-->

<h4>Overview</h4>
<h2>Helping the Reddit sales team unlock value from a key internal data tool.</h2>
<p>In April 2022 I joined Reddit’s Data Tools team and led design and research for a key internal analytics application used primarily by the sales team. I worked closely with an engineering partner to define and execute on product improvements that ultimately improved time to insights and increased sales productivity across Reddit.</p>

<h4>Sales at Reddit</h4>
<h2>The Reddit sales team is responsible for getting clients interested in advertising on Reddit, committing spend, and ultimately delivering successful advertising campaigns for their clients.</h2>
<p>The sales cycle is generally in three phases: outreach, plan and launch, and assess (retrospective). To support the cycle, sales uses an internal analytics application to understand various data points to bring to client meetings and inform each phase. The phases and touchpoints with the platform are in more detail below.</p>

<h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
<h2>I conducted one-on-one interviews with the sales team to understand why and how they were using the platform, as well as challenges they faced.</h2>
<p>The sales cycle is generally in three phases: outreach, plan and launch, and assess (retrospective). To support the cycle, sales uses an internal analytics application to understand various data points to bring to client meetings and inform each phase. The phases and touchpoints with the platform are in more detail below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/reddit/sales-team.png" /></p>

<p>After just a few conversations an immediate and core problem emerged. The platform required use of a SQL-like query language; this was a major obstacle and product deterrent for a majority of sales. This screenshot shows top communities posting about the brand Mercedes Benz.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/reddit/bar%20chart.png" /></p>

<p>To use the application, the user types and runs a query to produce a data view. A few issues that arose from this experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Due to the technical nature, users commonly asked for help and took time away from engineering or well-versed sales teammates.</li>
  <li>Saving and using the same queries repeatedly. This limited use made users feel like they were missing out on other insights.</li>
  <li>Simple comparisons became repetitive time consuming tasks, for example, “are Redditors talking about sneakers more compared to last year?” requires two queries.</li>
  <li>The daunting feeling of having to learn the query language was off-putting to newer sales people.</li>
  <li>Abandoning the product altogether.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was clear that the solution could provide more value to the sales team and I viewed this problem as an existential threat to the longevity and widespread adoption of the product at Reddit. My focus was on increasing the proportion of the sales team utilizing the product in a self-sufficient way and improving overall usability.</p>

<h4>Exploration</h4>
<h2>I hypothesized that a major product pivot was required. Ideation focused on alternatives to querying and getting feedback from sales and my design team early and often.</h2>
<p>I brainstormed various solutions to make querying less technical including a “chart builder” and “plain text querying” but ultimately users gravitated towards a simpler experience that required less overall effort: search forms and reports. I focused on refining this experience to provide as much useful information as possible.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/reddit/initial-keyword-search.png" /></p>

<p>I prioritized information to support common sales needs. Information prioritization was directly informed by sales’ touchpoints (where users had the most pain) and the common queries they searched for.</p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h2>After two rounds of feedback and user testing the solution was considered a vast improvement.</h2>
<p>A number of refinements to the design include visual alignment with Reddit’s internal design system. With the sales team clamoring for a ship date, we launched the solution later in the same quarter.</p>

<h3>Empowering the user with simple form searching</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/reddit/1-Reddit-forms.png" />
In interviews I often heard the simplicity of searching in plain text was desired. Feedback was also pointed at the usefulness of the advanced filtering, allowing search accuracy to be improved - a common pain point.</p>

<h3>A way to see growth or dips in high level metrics</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/reddit/2-Reddit-numbers.png" />
A common sales task is understanding whether growth (or drops) in discussion occurred for a topic or brand.</p>

<h3>Key information, grouped by varied metrics</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/reddit/3-Reddit-charts-tabs.png" />
I learned that sales doesn’t have a single metric they unanimously care about. Because of that, users can view top communities based on the metric that matters most to them or their client.</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>
<h2>A quarter after launch we saw a number of signals indicating strong success with our project.</h2>

<ul>
  <li>~120 Keyword users per week (35% of sales team) compared to 12% normally</li>
  <li>~1.7 queries per user compared to 1.2 normally</li>
  <li>Qualitative indicators include much adoration in our Slack #sales channel</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, the success and reception of this report led to two additional and important reports I designed, a “share of voice” and “communities” report.</p>
