			<!-- Overview !-->

<h4>Overview</h4>
<h2>Dashboards help teams and admins visualize their projects and work through a collection of data and charts.</h2>
<p>The product team received signal that customers struggled to use dashboards. Overall adoption was low and support tickets and training around dashboards were repetitive and time consuming for our teams.</p>

<p>I researched, designed, and usability tested a solution that made it easier to get started with dashboards. After launch, we saw higher than expected adoption and a steep reduction in support tickets around dashboards.</p>

<!-- Research !-->

<hr class="section" />

<h4>Defining the Problem</h4>
<h2>The process began by gathering insights from dashboard users, internal teams, and our competition.</h2>

<p>Based on common pain points and behavior we observed, I created these insights and goals to inform ideation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Help users with dashboard creation.</strong> <br />How can we save admins time, especially compared to competitors?</li>
  <li><strong>How might we support existing behavior?</strong> <br />Users use dashboards in very similar ways, down to the data and charts used.</li>
  <li><strong>How might we help users with filters?</strong> <br />Creating dashboards is difficult because of filters.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Exploration</h4>
<h2>We explored low-fidelity sketches and tested a prototype with users to see if our solution resonated and how we could improve.</h2>
<p>Exploration was focused around dashboard creation and supporting existing behavior, due to constraints of the project. I thought of possible user flows that would help the user with these pain points and created a prototype around a template idea to be tested with users. Below is the “New Dashboard” flow I mocked up into a prototype - depending on the template chosen, a pre-made dashboard is created for the user.</p>

<h4>Refining</h4>
<h2>Minor refinements were made to ensure customization was discoverable and I consolidated the flow into a single step.</h2>

<p>Critical feedback was focused on the individual tiles chosen for each template. I refined the design to ensure users knew they could still customize their dashboards, and consolidated the modal flow into a single step.</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>
<h2>60% of all dashboards used a template, while Customer Success saw a reduction in support tickets related to dashboards by 30%</h2>
