An organization hiring their first designer is only the first step in investing towards UX. When I joined Skilljar, I encountered a product development process sans UX. It was my duty to bring design to Skilljar, while making the most out of being a one-man team. In this case study, I share how I put a focus on users and the business to improve the quality of the product.</p>

<h2>Learning Internally</h2>
<h4>Stakeholder interviews</h4>
<p>When joining any company, there is always a tremendous amount that can be learned internally before spending time with users. Sales, Customer Success, Support, Marketing, and even leadership have lots of interactions with customers and prospects. These interactions often inform their views on the user experience, who the users are, problems within the product, and opportunities for improvements. <b>Do not let these perspectives go to waste!</b> Involving other teams is a great way to build relationships and communication channels outside of the design team, and ensures important voices are heard.</p>

<p>As an example, our Senior Sales Consultant told me about how unintuitive theming was in Skilljar, something she saw repeatedly throughout the sales process. This informed an eventual “theme builder” hackweek project I designed that was well-received internally to gasps and ahhs when I presented it to the company. While it was only a hackweek project, the reception it received was a clue into the value of solving that problem.</p>

<h4>Utilize Tribal Knowledge</h4>
<p>Similar to interviews, internal workshops are great for involving other teams and collaborating as a group to learn about users. I found that knowledge was so ingrained in the Customer Success, Implementation and Sales teams, that you can spend hours getting information from them. If you run short of time or budget to speak with users, this is the next best bet to get moving fast.</p>

<span class="caption">Persona posters were placed alongside the product and engineering teams to remind us of the important user groups Skilljar serves. Visiting customers and internal teams often stopped by and discussed the contents.</span></p>

<p>Another fun exercise I ran was “despicable design”, which I picked up from <a href="https://articles.uie.com/despicable-design-when-going-evil-is-the-perfect-technique/">Jared Spool</a>. I invited non-design and product folks to try their hand at making the UX worse - a fun exercise that while not well-intentioned, got a room full of people thinking about the user experience. I highly suggest running that workshop - it only takes an hour.

<h2>Learning Externally</h2>

<h4>Customer interviews</h4>
<p>To a product team that isn’t accustomed to user interviews, this can sometimes be tough to get going. Communicate the need to learn from customers and work with appropriate channels to set up time, even only 30 minutes, to speak directly with customers. In my case, I had to coordinate with Customer Success and Marketing to get the ball rolling. I learned a lot from remote interviews alone - but ideally contextual inquiry, visiting the user where they work and use the product is more ideal.</p>

<h4>Set up channels internally</h4>
<p>Another way to learn from customers is to have ongoing communication channels with Sales and Customer Success. Those teams at Skilljar had a “monthly top 10” product requests list, where high priority feature requests were ranked. I was able to dive deeper and learn more about a feature request by learning directly from Sales or CS, who were able to provide information including call logs that helped me understand users’ problems in context.</p>

<h2>Key Design Activities</h2>

<h4>Spend considerable time defining problems</h4>
<p>Part of design is articulating the problem - what is it your solving and why is it important to the user and business? This is doubly important when bringing your craft into the product development process. Understanding the problems and showing how your design solves for them is key and helps others level up their understanding of design too.</p>

<h4>Create design principles</h4>
<p>Another way to improve design fluency across the board is developing design principles, especially in collaboration with others who know the users well. Design principles work as an anchor to help guide your design decisions at a high level, and can help you choose one design direction over another in some cases. Design principles should anchor to your understanding of users (Personas) and their needs.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h2>Keep on Learning</h2>
<h4>Design easy feedback mechanisms within the product</h4>
<p>During a product refresh, our team craved an easy way for customers to give us feedback during a beta program. Once the beta program was over, we decided to keep in the feedback mechanism as a way to learn from customers indefinitely about what was working for them in the product, and what wasn’t.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/sj/sj-feedback.png" /> 
<span class="caption">We placed the feedback icon in the header for easy access and discoverability.</span></p>

<h4>Catalog your learning</h4>
<p>With all of this information I catalogged it into a research database. I used <a href="https://airtable.com/universe/expShuhNMi0Oc0xpb/polaris-ux-nuggets">AirTable</a> to log all of my learnings so they were easily referencable in the future and made sure my team had easy access.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>While there is always more I could’ve done - I felt these simple activities brought lots of knowledge and understanding to the business and ultimately the teams responsible for building great product. There was nothing more satisfying than hearing a customer say one of our personas was “very accurate” in describing her during a visit. I hope you can utilize some of these techniques if you haven’t already.</p>
