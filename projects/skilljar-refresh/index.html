<h4>Overview</h4>
<h2>Fresh off raising $16MM, Skilljar is a leading provider of LMS capabilities in the emerging customer training space.</h2>

<p>In late 2018, Skilljar wanted to address critical feedback from customers and prospects, that the platform needed modernizing.</p>

<p>I worked collaboratively with leadership, Product, and Engineering teams and led UX and visual design for this milestone project. After launch, we saw rave feedback around our new visual style and the UX improvements to navigation.</p>

<h4>Defining Goals</h4>
<h2>Balancing business and user goals, a visual and structural overhaul to the admin dashboard was considered in-scope.</h2>

<p>Consensus was formed around not just a visual overhaul, but also improving the core application. Our team found navigation and search to be key improvements that could feasibly be included in this project.</p>

<hr class="section" />

<h4>Exploring and Refining</h4>
<h2>Through a collaborative and iterative approach, a new style and navigation improvements were formed and shared with users through an early opt-in beta program that lasted months.</h2>

<p>The beta program was structured in a way to encourage beta-testers to provide key feedback. This helped our team address bugs with implementation and surfaced feedback around styling and layouts.</p>

<h4>Components</h4>
<h2>Collaborating with front-end leads, styles were finalized into a library that engineering could draw from as needed.</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/cases/sj/ds-cover.png" class="mt-4" /></p>

<p>Skilljarâ€™s front-end and back-end teams were able to carry out implementation of the new style utilizing the component library. I supported the team with various spec documents outlining layouts, components, and core visuals.</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>
<h2>With qualitative feedback being a key measure of success, we saw rave feedback from prospects and customers around the sidebar navigation and new visual styling.</h2>
